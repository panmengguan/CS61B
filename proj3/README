Project 3: Fun with Graphs

The files in this directory form a very skimpy skeleton that you are flesh
out into a full system.  You may not add or delete public types, nor
may you add or delete public or protected members (nested classes or
interfaces, methods, constructors, class variables, or instance
variables) or change their types or signatures.  Otherwise, you are
free to add package private types and private or package private
members to classes, and generally to change anything else.



Files:

Makefile:      Does standard tasks such as building the application,
               cleaning up unneeded files, running tests, and
               performing style checks.  Used as a configuration file by 
               the 'gmake' program.

staff-version:
               A file containing just the name of the current public release
               version in the public/proj1/tags directory.  (Helpful when
               trying to figure out what merges to do.)

graph/         Package containing general graph-related data types.
               
        Makefile:
               See above.
               
        Graph.java:
               Interface defining what a "graph" is.
               
        DirectedGraph.java:
               Implementation of directed graphs.
               
        UndirectedGraph.java
               Implementation of undirected graphs.
               
        Edge.java:
               Represents edges in a graph.

        Vertex.java
               Represents vertices in a graph.

        DepthFirst.java:
               Represents a depth-first graph traversal.

        Traversal.java:
               Represents breadth-first and other general graph traversals.

        Graphs.java:
               A* search algorithms on graphs.

        NoLabel.java:
               Convenience type representing absent labels (for unlabeled 
               vertices and edges).

        StopException.java:
        RejectException.java:
               Unchecked exception classes that may be used by specialized
               graph trsversals to modify the course of the traversal.

        Iteration.java:
               Abstract class that allows Iterators to be used in foreach
	       loops (for (T x : E) { ... }).

    Classes related to graphs with weighted vertices and edges.
               
        Weighted.java:
               An interface describing types that have a (readable) weight.
               
        Weightable.java:
               An interface describing types (specifically types of graph label)
               that have a settable numeric weight.
               
        Weighting.java
               An interface describing a functional object that can read
               the weights of labels.

        Weighter.java:
               An interface describing a functional object that can read and
               set the weights of labels.

	Distancer.java:
	       An interface describing a functional object that computes a
	       distance between two objects.
