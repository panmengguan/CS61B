CS61B Lab #11

First, initialize your project 3 directory if you haven't already.

Getting Started: Input
----------------------

The two applications for this semster, make and trip, both require that you
do some input.  Since this always seems to get people confused, let's get it
over with.

A. Augment make.Main (possibly adding more classes or methods if it seems
   to clean things up) so that it reads from the file named fileInfoName
   according to the spec.  Set it up to build two things:
       1. A mapping from NAME to CHANGEDATE, where CHANGEDATEs are integers,
          and NAMEs are Strings, as per the spec, and
       2. A current time (an integer) from the first line of the file.
   Put these into variables in Main for now.

B. Augment make.Main (again, adding more classes or methods if desired) so that
   it reads all of the file MAKEFILENAME, written as per the specification.
   Design a suitable type, Rule, to hold the contents of any rule (which
   consists of a target, a list of dependences, and a list of (non-empty)
   command lines).  Be sure to ignore comments and blank lines, as per the spec.
   Leave a list of Rules in a variable in Main for now.

C. Augment trip.Main.trip to read in the file mapFileName.  For now, create
   two suitable classes, Location and Distance, and create two lists
   (of Locations and Distances) in trip.Main to hold them.  The classes
   should have fields for the parts of a Location and Distance that you
   you read.

You might throw some of this away in the real project, but at least it will
be done!  I suggest that you NOT stuff everything into the make and trip
methods, since reading data is just one step in what they do.

When done, simply commit your updated project 3 directories (no need to
submit them).
